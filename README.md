## Playing Bingo

Click on 'Play a Bingo Game' to be taken to the 'Create a Bingo Game' screen. You can type in a new to be used for the title of your Bingo game -- this is so others can find your game online and join it -- however, you can choose to leave this blank to receive the default room name of '*Your Username*'s Room'. Click on Start Game to receive a Bingo card.

The computer will call out random numbers. If you have a value on your Bingo card matching a number that is called out, that value is automatically lit up. Once 5 values in a row are lit up on your card, whether horizontal, vertical, or diagonal, then you win. If you are playing against others, they will get the same random numbers called out at the same time you are. If they get 5 in a row before you, you lose.

## Playing Bango

Click on 'Play a Bango Game' to be taken to the 'Create a Bango Game' screen. You can type in a new to be used for the title of your Bingo game -- this is so others can find your game online and join it -- however, you can choose to leave this blank to receive the default room name of '*Your Username*'s Room'. Choose a game theme. The theme decides the type of values that will show up on your card. The available themes are:

- Dinner with the Family: *For values that pertain to things that would happen during a family dinner*
- A Typical Day at the Office: *For values that pertain to things that would happen in the office*
- Party Time: *For values that pertain to things that happen in a party*

Click on Start Game to receive a Bango card.

You will receive a card with values adhering to your choice of theme upon it. The idea is that, if you see something happening in your environment that matches the value on your card, you click on that value and it lits up. If others are playing with you, that value will light up on their cards at the same time as yours, and values they click on will light up on your card. The player who receives 5 lit up values in a row, wins.
